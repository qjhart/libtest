Administration of the [[https://www.ucdsitefarm.acsitefactory.com/][SiteFarm SiteFactory]].

** Installation

These installation instructions are different than those on the website, as I've
cloned the dev environment.  Under normal operations, I think you're only
expected to clone the theme, so that's added as a submodule to be consistent
with that setup as well. (I'm not completely sure about that though, since the
supplied bundle includes git repo info as well.)

You need to [[https://docksal.io/installation][Install Docksal]], to use this tooling.  Docksal is a suite of tools
that allow you to run drupal (also wordpress, node) in a containerized
envirionment, and also manages the network setup to give you a nice experience
with DNS etc.  Unfortunately for our team we have a name collision with `fin`.
I've renamed our fin tool `ucd-fin` for these tests.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/qjhart/libtest.git
cd ~/libtest
# Next untar the bundle that came from Sitefarm.  There are files here,
# eg. /vender that are explicily ignored in Sitefarms' setup.
# The files include the database.
tar -xvf libtest_*.tar.gz --exclude=sitefarm-library-theme --exclude=.gitmodules --exclude=.gitignore
fin themer/init
#+END_SRC

I'm pretty sure trying to switch to postgres would be
out of scope for the custom theming.

*** SiteFarm  Instructions

This is an abbreviated set of instructions. For full information on creating a
subtheme, please visit the [[https://sitefarm.ucdavis.edu/training/builders/setting-local-development][SiteFarm Local Installation training page]]

1. [[https://docksal.io/installation][Install Docksal]]

2. Navigate to the root of the unpacked folder that you downloaded from Site
   Factory. Be sure you're in the root of that directory. If you run ~ls -al~
   you should see files with names: .docksal, acquia-pipelines.yml,
   composer.lock, etc.
3. Run one command: `fin themer/init`



** Operation

Fin maintains it's own docker-compose system, and that's how the website is
managed.  You can access that the  overall system with ~fin system status~

*** Local Domain Name
One installed, your site is available at [[http://libtest.local/][libtest.local]].  The ~fin init~ script
actually updates your ~/etc/hosts~ file with this path.  The local 192. IP range
is also used by fin. I'm not sure if that's taken from the system standard
docker installation.  Lot's of the ~fin system~ commands affect the DNS settings.

*** TODO SSH-Agent
Docksal uses ssh to harden some of it's setup, but I don't know what.

*** TODO Uploading database changes



* Themes

** Installing Stater KIT themes

Following the instructions, I'm installing the iet themes, in the ~theme-basic~
branch.  However their instructions are a bit off.  I beleive the better
location for the themes are in ~docroot/themes/~.  Note that IET has named their
subtheme the same for both, so you can only install the basic-redesign or the
advanced-redesign, but not both

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cd docroot/themes/
for i in advanced-redesign; do
  echo $i
  tar=$i.tar.gz
  get=https://bitbucket.org/ietwebdev/sitefarm-theme-one-subtheme-starterkits/get
  wget ${get}/${tar}
  tar -xzf ${tar}
  mv ietwebdev-sitefarm-theme-one-subtheme-* $i
  rm $tar
done
#+END_SRC

New themes are available immediately.  You can enable the via the admin page, or
with the drush command theme:enable

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
fin exec drush pm-list --type=theme
#+END_SRC

** Creating theme with the theme wizard

The other method of creating a theme uses fin commands, I'm going to try this in
the ~theme-wizard~ branch.

For whatever reason trying to add the --theme and --machine parameters kill this
generate theme command

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
fin drupal sitefarm:generate:subtheme  \
--theme-path=/themes \
--description='Library sitefarm theme.' \
--advanced=yes \
--ckeditor=yes \
--realtime-editing=yes \
--local-domain=libtest.local \
--regions=no --yes
#+END_SRC

The output of this includes this info:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

You will need to compile the Sass and Js using Node.js by running "npm install" from within the new theme
 directory. Please see the README.md file for directions on how to do this.

I'm actually not sure yet how fin maintains the npm installations of their
themes.  This probably need not be done by the dev machine?
