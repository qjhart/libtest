Local Installation training page]]

** Run your SiteFarm Site Locally

This installation uses [[https://docksal.io/][Docksal]] for the development environment setup, with
Apache, PHP, and MySQL (Maybe postgresql later?).

1. [[https://docksal.io/installation][Install Docksal]]
2. Navigate to the root of the unpacked folder that you downloaded from Site
   Factory. Be sure you're in the root of that directory. If you run ~ls -al~
   you should see files with names: .docksal, acquia-pipelines.yml,
   composer.lock, etc.
3. Run one command: `fin themer/init`
